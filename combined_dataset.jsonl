It belongs to the whole Universe for it is delivered to the Universe by the source and embodiment of Universe. We salute and bow down to Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who spoke the Bhagavad Gītā out of His infinite love and compassion for all beings.\n\nWhenever unrighteousness, *adharma* becomes predominant and *dharma*, righteous living declines and the Yoga of Enlightenment is lost, *Parabrahma* Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Consciousness appears again and again to revive this sacred yoga, to protect and to enrich the devoted beings; and destroys *adharma* to re-establish the pure and everlasting *dharma*—the Science of Enlightenment. *dharma saṁsthāpanārthāya sambhavāmi yuge yuge*—this is Śrī Kṛṣṇa's promise and the essence and spirit of the Gītā.\n\nGītā is also called *Brahmavidyā*—the Knowledge of Brahman, the supreme absolute truth; it is *Jīvan Mukti Vijñāna*—the Science of Living Enlightenment.

{"text": "## **The Divine Song of the Bhagavad Gītā**\n\n*Gītā* is known as *Gītāśastra*, the essence and most important part of the ancient knowledge base of the Vedic tradition. This tradition is an expression of the experiences of great sages. *Vedas* and *Upaniṣads*, the foundation of *śruti* literature, arose from the insight, vision, and consciousness of completion of these sages, who were raised into a no-mind state of *Advaita* (non-duality). These scriptures are as old as humanity, as eternal as truth, and the first and truest expressions in the journey of man's search for truth.\n\nUnlike the *Vedas*, which were revealed to great sages, or the *Upaniṣads*, which were the teachings of these enlightened sages, *Gītā* is part of the great Bhārata's (Bharat's) history narrated by Śrī Veda Vyāsa or Śrī Kṛṣṇa Dvāipāyana Vyāsa, one of the great enlightened sages and the compiler of all scriptures and hymns. *Gītā* is scribed by Śrī Ganeṣa, the elephant God who embodies pure wisdom and joyful spontaneity. It is narrated as the direct expression of the Divine Himself. It is because of Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa's direct presence that the Mahābhārat, and jeweled in it, the Bhagavad Gītā is the indisputable authority of the greatest revelation of Truth. The *Gītā* is the sacred text incarnation of the Absolute Divine.\n\nNo other epic or part of an epic has the special status and space of the *Gītā*. No other book but the *Gītā* gives a scientific, systematic, applied science of living joyfully in completion, while empowering the human action-field with authenticity to evolve into a responsible Divine play-field.\n\nCalled the royal supreme knowledge and the royal secret of secrets *rājavidyā rājaguhyaṁ* (9.2), this one sacred book conveys the essence of knowledge contained in all written and oral Vedic truths to enrich the simplest to complex Hindus at all planes. It holds within itself the direct key to every possible human enquiry, the solution to every dilemma of emotions, and the sublime righteous path and goal of every quest of rising or falling civilizations for every age, time, or geography. As a consequence of the presence of the *Gītā*, the Mahābhārat epic itself is considered a sacred Hindu scripture.\n\n*Gītā* arose from the super consciousness of Śri Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme God, the complete Incarnation *Purṇāvatār*, and is therefore considered *Gītāśastra*—the essential scripture, knowing which, one is liberated from all incompletions, *yaj jñātvā mokṣyase asubhāt* (9.1) and *Gītopaniṣad—*the essence of all Upanishads, the purest and highest knowledge to be ever known and cognized because it gives the direct experience of the Self— *pavitram idam uttamam pratyakṣāvagaṁ dharmyaṁ* (9.2).", "source": "bg_decoded", "book_id": "9d8fe9e90f5e07d315e1ed342c5cb6db"}
{"text": "### **Mahābhārat Is the Story of Your Life**\n\nMahābhārat, literally meaning the great Bhārata, is a grand narration about the nation and civilization, which is now known as Bharat. It was then a nation ruled by king Bhārata and his descendants.\n\n> *dharme cārthe ca kāme ca mokśe ca bharatarśabha I yadihasti tadanyatra yannehasti na tatkvachit II*\n\n> > *~ Mahābhārat, Ādi Parva 56.33 ~*\n\n'O Scion of Bharat race, whatever *dharma* (righteousness), *artha* (economic growth), *kāma* (pleasure) and *mokṣa (*liberation) exist in this text is found elsewhere, but what is not found in this text does not exist elsewhere.'\n\nLook into your life! Your whole life is nothing but the Mahābhārat War. The Mahābharāt should be read again and again to understand the intricacies of life, the complications of life, and the ability to handle life.\n\nThe true story of this perfectly recorded epic is about two warring clans, Kauravas and Pānḍavas, closely related to one another. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the blind king of Hastināpur and father of the 100 Kaurava brothers was the brother of Pānḍu, whose children were the five Pānḍava princes. It is a tale of strife between cousins and ultimately between *dhārmic* and *adhārmic*, righteous and unrighteous civilizations.\n\nSince Dhṛtarāṣṭra was blind, Pānḍu was made the king of Hastināpura. Pānḍu was cursed by a sage that he would die if he ever entered into a physical relationship with his wives. He therefore had no children. Vyāsa says that all the five Pānḍava children were born to their mothers Kuntī and Mādri through the blessing of divine beings. Pānḍu handed over the kingdom and his children to his blind brother Dhṛtarāṣṭra and retired to meditate in the forest.\n\nKuntī, who is the embodiment of *tapas*, spiritual penance, had received a boon when she was still a young unmarried adolescent, that she could summon any divine power at will to father a child. Before she married, she tested her boon. The Sun god, Sūrya appeared before her. Karṇa was born to her as a result. In fear of social reprisals, she cast the newborn away in a river. Yudhiṣṭra, Bhīma and Arjuna were born to Kuntī after her marriage by invocation of her powers, and the twins Nakula and Sahadeva were born to Mādri, the second wife of Pānḍu.\n\nYudhiṣṭra was born to Kuntī as a result of her being blessed by Yama, the god of death, *dharma* and justice, Bhīma by Vāyu, the god of wind, and Arjuna by Indra, god of all the divine beings. Nakula and Sahadeva, the youngest Pānḍava twins, were born to Mādri, through the Divine Aśvini twins.\n\nDhṛtarāṣṭra had a hundred sons through his wife Gāndhārī. The eldest of these Kaurava princes was Duryodhana. Duryodhana felt no love for his five Pānḍava cousins. He made many unsuccessful attempts, along with his brother Duśśāsana, to kill the Pānḍava brothers. Kuntī's eldest son Karṇa, whom she had cast away at birth, was found and brought up by a chariot driver in the palace, and by a strange twist of fate, joined hands with Duryodhana.\n\nDhṛtarāṣṭra gave Yudhiṣṭra one half of the Kuru kingdom on his coming of age, since the Pānḍava prince was the rightful heir to the throne that his father Pānḍu had vacated. Yudhiṣṭra ruled from his new capital Indraprastha, along with his brothers Bhīma, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva. Arjuna won the hand of princess Draupadī, daughter of the king of Pāñcāla, in a *svayaṁvara*, a marital contest in which princes fought for the hand of a fair damsel. In fulfillment of their mother Kuntī's desire that the brothers share everything equally, Draupadī became the wife of all five Pānḍava brothers.\n\nDuryodhana persuaded Yudhiṣṭra to join a gambling session, where his cunning uncle Śakunī defeated the Pānḍava king. Yudhiṣṭra lost all that he owned—his kingdom, his brothers, his wife and himself, to Duryodhana. Duśśāsana shamed Draupadī in public by trying to disrobe her. The Pānḍava brothers and Draupadī were forced to go into exile for fourteen years, with the condition that in the last year they should live incognito or *ajyāta vāsa*.\n\nAt the end of the fourteen years, the Pānḍava brothers tried to reclaim their kingdom. In this effort they were helped by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the king of the Yādava clan, who is the eighth divine incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu. However, Duryodhana refused to yield even a needlepoint of land, and as a result, the Great War, the War of Mahābhārat ensued. In this war, various rulers of the entire nation that is modern Bharat aligned with one or the other of these two clans, the Kauravas or the Pānḍavas.\n\nKṛṣṇa offered to join with either of the two clans. He says, 'One of you may have Me unarmed. I will not take any part in the battle. The other may have my entire Yādava army.' When the offer was first made to Duryodhana, he predictably chose the large and well-armed Yādava army, *Nārāyaṇī Senā*, in preference to the unarmed Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna joyfully and gratefully chose his dearest friend, his life mentor and his Guru, Kṛṣṇa, *Nārāyaṇa*, to be his unarmed charioteer!", "source": "bg_decoded", "book_id": "9d8fe9e90f5e07d315e1ed342c5cb6db"}
{"text": "## **Amidst The Warfield, Appears The Song Of God**\n\n*Oṁ pārthāya pratibodhitāṁ bhagavatā nārāyaṇena svayaṁ vyāsena gratitāṁ purāṇa muninā madhye mahābhāratam I advaitāmṛta varṣiṇīṁ bhagavatīṁ aṣṭādaśā'dhyāyinīṁ amba tvām anusandadhāmi bhagavadgīte bhavadveṣiṇīm II*\n\n> 'Oṁ, I meditate upon you, *Bhagavad Gītā*, the affectionate Divine Mother, showering the nectar of *advaita*, non-duality and destroying rebirth, incorporated into the midst of Mahābhārat of eighteen chapters by sage Vyāsa, the author of the purāṇas and imparted to Arjuna by Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa, Himself.'\n\n> > *~ Invocation Verse of Bhagavad Gītā*\n\nBhagavad Gītā appears in the heart of Mahābhārat in Bhīṣma Parva, the sixth chapter of its eighteen chapters. Veda Vyāsa, the narrator, in glorifying the *Gītā* sings, 'the one who drinks the water of Ganges (the sacred river for Hindus) attains liberation, what to speak of the one who drinks the nectar of *Gītā*? *Gītā* is the essential nectar of the Mahābhārat, *bhāratamṛta sarvasvam* as it is directly spoken by Nārāyaṇa, Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa Himself.'\n\nThe armies assembled in the vast field of Kurukṣetra, now in the state of Haryana in modern-day Bharat. All the kings and princes were related to one another, and were often on opposite sides. Facing the Kaurava army and his friends, relatives and teachers, Arjuna was overcome by remorse and guilt, and wanted to walk away from the battle out of total powerlessness unbecoming an invincible warrior among warriors.\n\nTHE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM BHAGAWAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM's dialogue with Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukṣetra out of His utmost concern and love for him and humanity is the content of Bhagavad Gītā. Of its seven hundred and forty-five (745) verses, Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa sings the *Gītā* in six hundred and twenty (620) verses responding to Arjuna's fifty-seven (57) enquiries. Śrī Kṛṣṇa persuades Arjuna to give-up his powerlessness unfitting an *Ārya*—the spiritually evolved one who understands human life and urges him to raise himself again as *Parantapa—*the conqueror of enemy, and take up arms and vanquish his enemies.\n\n'They are already dead,' says Śrī Kṛṣṇa, 'All those who are facing you have been already killed by Me. Go ahead and do what you have to do. That is your responsibility. Do not worry about the outcome. Leave that to Me.'\n\n*Gītā* is the ultimate practical teaching on the inner science of spirituality that expresses as outer victory and success in life now and after. It is not, as some scholars incorrectly claim, a promotion of violence. It is about the impermanence of the mind and body, and the need to go beyond the mind, ego and logic.\n\nBeing blind with self-doubt, king Dhṛtarāṣṭra does not participate in the war. His minister Sañjaya uses his power of clairvoyance bestowed by Veda Vyāsa to 'see' and relate to king Dhṛtarāṣṭra the goings on the battlefield. It is in Sañjaya's voice that we hear *Gītā*, the dialogue between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna.\n\nAll the Kaurava princes as well as all their commanders such as Bhīṣma, Droṇa and Karṇa were killed in battle. The five Pānḍava brothers survived as winners and became the rulers of the combined kingdom.\n\nThis dialogue sung between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna is a dialogue between man and God or *Nara* and *Nārāyaṇa* as they are called in Saṃskṛit.\n\nArjuna's questions and doubts are those of each one of us. Nara Arjuna is the leader, the embodiment of responsibility representing the whole humanity that is burdened with the sufferings born from self-doubt, self-hatred and self-denial of its innate natural state of liberation, *mokṣa.* Only Nārāyaṇa as Śrī Kṛṣṇa can sport a divine smile on His face and sing the nectars of *Advaita*—space of infinity (non-duality) and *Sāṅkhya Yoga*—knowledge of completion in the midst of the waging world war.\n\nOnly Bhagavān, one possessed with infinite powers, infinite knowledge, infinite renunciation, and infinite riches, fame and beauty can declare the imperishable and eternal nature of the Self; and also give the direct experience of the Self to Arjuna in *Viśvarūpa Darśan Yoga* and culminate it with *Mokṣa Sannyāsa Yoga*—the yoga of liberation.\n\nThe answers of the Divine, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, transcend time and space. Śrī Kṛṣṇa's message is everlasting and joyfully performed, and is as valid today as it was on that fateful battlefield over five thousand years ago. The science of *Gītā* is the eternal technique of living in completion; the song of *Gītā* is the eternal life-enriching nectar, having no expiry date, time or age!", "source": "bg_decoded", "book_id": "9d8fe9e90f5e07d315e1ed342c5cb6db"}

{"text": "## **The Mahābhārata: A Reflection of Life**\n\nThe Mahābhārata war is a representation of life as it was lived in that age. Vyāsa, its author, is an unbiased historian who recorded the whole history as it happened without trying to apply any makeup. People ask whether the Mahābhārata war happened at all!\n\nLet me tell you this: If the Mahābhārata was a story and not history, Vyāsa should receive multiple Pulitzer prizes for his highly creative work! The Mahābhārata is the longest literary work in the whole world with one hundred thousand Saṃskṛit verses—the longest poem ever written with such delicate harmony of unmatched poetic perfection. It is larger than the Greek epics. Vyāsa had no computer, no tape recorder with speech-to-text capabilities. He dictated and Lord Ganeṣa wrote it down!\n\nThe Mahābhārata is like an ocean. It has at least 10,000 stories woven into it. All of these are seamlessly woven into the main text even though each is an independent event. Just imagine the effort required to create hundreds of thousands of characters and maintain the integrity of these characters throughout the epic without the help of editors. Do you think anyone could do it today?\n\nBecause it is impossible to create such a work of fiction, one needs to accept this as a compilation of true incidents that reflect the lifestyle in what is referred to as Tretā yuga, third quarter of Time, in our scriptures. This is how people behaved then and how people behave now. What happened then repeats itself now, again and again!\n\nThe Great War of Mahābhārata is the fight between the positive and negative thought patterns of the mind called the *saṁskāras* or the root thought patterns—meaning the deep identity or the earliest memory you carry and create about you and others. Please understand, don't think you carry only the identity about you, you also carry an identity of the world inside you and look at the world only through that. That is what I call root thought pattern—the identity through which you see you and the world.\n\nThe positive thought patterns are the Pānḍava princes and the negative thought patterns are the Kaurava princes. Kurukṣetra or the battlefield is the body. Arjuna is the individual consciousness and Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the enlightened Master, the supreme consciousness driving and guiding the individual consciousness.\n\nThe various commanders who led the Kaurava army represent the major incompletions of root patterns and conflicting patterns that the individual consciousness faces in its journey to Enlightenment or liberation, *mokṣa*. Bhīṣma, the grand patriarch of the Kuru clan who embodies *dharma*, represents the pattern of parental and societal conditioning. Droṇa, the teacher of both the Kauravas and the Pānḍavas, represents the conditioning from teachers who provide knowledge including spiritual guidance.\n\nŚakuni, the maternal uncle of Duryodhana, embodies the pattern of self-hatred, which is cunningness personified. Karṇa represents the restrictive influence of good deeds such as charity and compassion done out of incompletion from the pattern of feeling deprived. Finally, Duryodhana represents the ego or the self-denial pattern, which is the root of the root patterns and is the last to fall.\n\nParental and societal conditioning has to be overcome by rebelling against conventions. This is why, traditionally, those seeking the path of enlightenment are required to renounce the world as Sannyāsi and move away from civilization. This conditioning does not die as long as the body lives, but its influence drops.\n\nDroṇa represents all the best knowledge one imbibes and the teachers one encounters, who guide us but are unable to take us through to the ultimate flowering of enlightenment. It is difficult to give them up since one feels grateful to them. This is where the Enlightened Master, the incarnation, steps in and guides us.\n\nKarṇa is the repository of all good deeds, and it is his good deeds that stand in the way of his own Enlightenment. Śrī Kṛṣṇa has to take the load of Karṇa's *puṇya*, his meritorious deeds, before he could be liberated. The Enlightened Master guides one to drop one's attachment to good deeds arising out of what are perceived to be charitable and compassionate intentions. He also shows us that the quest for and the experience of enlightenment is the ultimate act of compassion that one can offer to the world.\n\nFinally, one reaches Duryodhana, one's ego or root-pattern, the most difficult to conquer as it leads one to self-destruction. One needs the full help of the Master here. It is subtle work, and even the Master's help may not be obvious, since at this point, sometimes the ego makes us deny and disconnect from the Master as well.\n\nThe Great War was between 180 million (18 crore) people—110 million on the Kaurava side representing our negative root patterns and conflicting patterns (*saṁskāras*) and 70 million on the Pānḍava side representing our positive patterns. The War lasted 18 days and nights. The number eighteen (18) has a great mystical significance. It essentially signifies our ten (10) senses that are made up of five *jñānendriya*—the senses of perception like taste, sight, smell, hearing, and touch, and five *karmendriya*—the senses initiating action like speech, bodily movements, etc., added to our eight (8) kinds of thoughts like lust, greed, etc. All eighteen need to be dropped for self-realization, completion, or liberation, *mokṣa*!\n\nMahābhārata is not just an epic history. It is not merely the fight between good and evil. It is the dissolution of both positive and negative *saṁskāras* (root patterns) that reside in our bio-memory or body-mind system, which must happen for the ultimate liberation. It is a tale of the path of living advaita, the process of powerfully living, radiating enlightenment and causing enlightenment for humanity.", "source": "bg_decoded", "book_id": "9d8fe9e90f5e07d315e1ed342c5cb6db"}
{"text": "## **Mahābhārata is the living legend. Bhagavad Gītā is the manual for Enlightenment.**\n\nUnderstand, the Gītā is not just for the people who worship Kṛṣṇa or who worship Śiva or who worship Arjuna or who worship Buddha or Mahāvira. Gītā is spoken by the Cosmos through Kṛṣṇa. That is why Vyāsa is using the word *Bhagavān* for Śrī Kṛṣṇa throughout the Gītā. So, it is universal. Nobody can claim it or own it as it is given by the Universe to the Hindu society, to the whole civilization. It is not a personal property of anybody; not even the personal property of Hindus. Once it is delivered, it belongs to the whole world!\n\nThe essence of the whole Bhagavad Gītā is the Master awakening responsibility in the disciple. That is why everywhere the Gītā talks only about responsibility!\n\nThrough '*karmaṇy ev'ādhikāraste mā phaleṣu kadācana*' (2.47)—you have the right to work, but never to the outcome of the work', through '*tvakvottiṣṭha parantapa*' (2.3)—Giving up your powerlessness, arise, O Parantapa' and through '*uddhared ātmanā'tmānaṁ*' (6.5)—raise yourself by yourself ', Śrī Kṛṣṇa is awakening the responsibility in Arjuna—Guru is awakening the responsibility in all of us through the awakening of Arjuna, the hero of Gītā.\n\nWhen you study the Gītā, you will find that Arjuna's logic seems to be very intelligent. He does not want to fight. But Kṛṣṇa emphasizes the intelligent ones need to enter into the fight from the space of *advaita* (non-duality), with the power and joy of feeling responsibility.\n\nOnly to a close friend with whom you can open your heart can your struggles be opened. Only when you are able to respect somebody more and more by knowing his struggles and conflicts, by knowing the success he achieved, you become a friend to him. But, by knowing somebody's struggles and conflicts, if you start judging him, there is no friendliness. It is an envious relationship waiting to vomit enmity. It is a seed sown with poison.\n\nHere, Kṛṣṇa shares Gītā to His own closest dearmost friend, Arjuna, who is beyond any envy or incompletion, to whom He can really show *viśvarūpa* (cosmic form) and reveal all His dimensions, with whom He has a freedom to just say, 'Do not yield to this degrading impotence of powerlessness,' 'Do it Kaunteya! O son of Kuntī, just do it,' '*nānuśocitum arhasi*' (2.25)—Do not grieve for the body,' and '*mat-karma-kṛn mat-paramo mad-bhakaḥ*' (11.55)—Do My work! Be My devotee! Always undividedly think of Me, you shall enter into Me.'\n\nFinally, Kṛṣṇa goes to the extreme of saying, '*sarva dharmān parityaja mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja*' (18.66)—Give up all your concepts and ideas about *dharma*, about right and wrong. Just surrender to Me. I will liberate you.\n\nTo say these words of surrender, what an intimate understanding, what a feeling connection, what a space of completion between Master-disciple, beloved-friend should have been there between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna. Kṛṣṇa summarizes His Gītā saying, drop your life at My feet. I will not cheat you, I will think for you. I will see to it you achieve the ultimate—*mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucah*—I will liberate you, do not fear or worry!\n\nLike Arjuna many thousand years ago, you are here on the warfield of your life in a dialogue with the living Enlightened Master, the rare living Incarnation in this book.\n\nThis is a tremendous opportunity to resolve all life questions, to complete with root thought patterns and to clear all self-doubts by listening into the Master's words and allowing His energy to rewrite your future! This is an extraordinary possibility to awaken your true nature, to arise with your inner powers, and to cause your highest reality—with the Master driving your Self into the absolute victory of life—Living Enlightenment, Living Advaita.\n\n> *yatra yogeśvaraḥ kṛṣṇo yatra pārtho dhanurdharaḥ I tatra śrīrvijaya bhūtir dhrūvā nītir matirmama II 18.78*\n\n'Wherever there is Yogeśvara Kṛṣṇa, the Master of all mystics, and wherever there is Pārtha (Arjuna), the supreme carrier of bow and arrow, there will certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary powers, and morality. That is my opinion.'", "source": "bg_decoded", "book_id": "9d8fe9e90f5e07d315e1ed342c5cb6db"}
{"text": "### **The Great 'Why'**\n\nThe *Bhagavad Gītā* opens with the great 'WHY', reflecting the personal crisis that we all face at some point of our lives.\n\nWe are drawn into the protagonist Arjuna's life at a crucial moment, when the renowned young prince is getting ready for a bloody battle against a huge army consisting of his own family, cousin, and teachers. Struggling with fears, a misconstrued sense of duty, and an awakening consciousness, the young prince is caught in the dilemma of his life.\n\nEven after five thousand years, Arjuna's dilemma is still alive in humanity's experience of life. Our questions are hardly different from Arjuna's...\n\n- Why are we here?\n- Why do we do what we do in our lives?\n- Why don't we find fulfillment, even after years of working for success in the world?\n- Why do more and more challenges await us, even after we solve and overcome numerous challenges?\n- How can we become spiritually mature and integrated individuals? Why is this path even required?\n\nThis '*Why*?' can be answered in a very simple way—You are here to manifest your ultimate Possibility!\n\nBut each one of you has to discover your own answer to this '*Why*'. Any other answer can only be an inspiration for you to discover your *own* answer. We can only move when we have the ability to handle this great '*Why*'. Whether you know it or not, only your deepest conviction about your '*Why'*, only your deepest clarity about your purpose, can give you the inspiration, energy, and courage to face life.\n\nThis great 'Why' is the seed of God himself! This seed is put inside you when you are sent to planet Earth, so that you do not rest until you become a tree and bear fruit. Please understand, every seed has an energy called *vīrya*, which does not rest till it produces more seeds. Even if you eat the seed, you cannot destroy it, because that *vīrya* still goes into your body and does its job in some other way! The question 'Why' is the *vīrya* put into your very DNA structure to help you realize yourself.\n\nThis is the journey that Arjuna undertakes through the Gītā. Under the compassionate guidance of the enlightened master Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna faces and realizes the meaning of the great 'Why', to become a realized soul.\n\nJust like Arjuna, you too will not be able to rest until you realize the meaning of the great 'Why' for you.\n\nJust as Kṛṣṇa addresses Arjuna's questions, THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM BHAGAWAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM addresses the readers' questions and doubts, guiding us on the path of transformation, refusing to give up on us until we discover our full potential and live like Gods on earth.

{"text": "### **The Art of Listening**\n\nThrough the entire opening chapter of the Gītā, it is Arjuna who continuously speaks, while Kṛṣṇa listens, listens, and listens!\n\nOnly an intelligent man will allow the other person to speak. We all continuously speak to each other, but a 'real' conversation does not happen. We simply carry out simultaneous monologues with each other. We are polite enough to pretend that we are listening, so that we will, in turn, be heard. You need intelligence to allow the other person to speak. You need intelligence to listen!\n\nWhen you listen to others, you listen to yourself. And when you don't listen to others, you also don't listen to yourself. Are you getting it? Only when you listen to you, you will be able to listen to others. When you listen to others, you will also listen to YOU! Because any listening that happens, happens from the space of completion. Please understand, you can only listen when you are complete. If there is any incompletion in you, you will not be able to listen.\n\nWhat is incompletion? For example, you are sitting here right now, hearing me speak, but you are not listening to me, you are thinking—'I have not done this, I have not done that, this has not happened, that has not happened, I am restless'–that is incompletion. If you have such incompletions inside, be very clear, you will not be listening to me. You may be sitting here out of compulsion or some other reason, but you will not be listening to me. And when you don't listen, more and more incompletions happen. It is a vicious circle.\n\nIf you *listen*, especially to the words that come out of the space of completion of an enlightened being, you will suddenly see that the energy of those very words goes and changes your inner space.\n\nSee, when you come to me and tell me about your problems, I give you my authentic listening. That is why you suddenly feel light; you suddenly feel that all your problems are not big anymore. It is the power of listening. Listening awakens your intuition.

{"text": "### Arjuna's Root Pattern\n\nWhen THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM BHAGAWAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM listens to Arjuna, He is interested in Arjuna's real problem, not what Arjuna is complaining about. He is not interested in just expressing what He knows. He allows Arjuna to speak into His listening, so that He can go to the root of the problem and address the issue. He knows that once He allows Arjuna to express his problems, Arjuna himself can find a solution to them. And as Arjuna continues to speak, he exposes the root of his problem—his root thought pattern.\n\nThe first strong cognition you receive in your life, which influences you to continue to function based on the same cognition, is a root thought pattern! It is the pattern you develop when powerlessness takes you over for the first time in your life. Your pure cognition is imbalanced and your mind is born!\n\nThe way you behave, feel and respond, all come from this root thought pattern. It is the limiting cognition that happens in you and fills you at a very young age, overpowering you. Sometimes it is fear, sometimes it is greed, sometimes it is jealousy and sometimes it is the decision to prove yourself. Sometimes, it is just plain confusion and worry!\n\nThroughout the initial chapters of the Gītā, Arjuna is operating out of his root thought pattern—his parental and societal conditioning struggling with all the dos and don'ts that he learnt from society. The moment he sees that the enemy he has to fight are his own extended family, he is overcome by powerlessness and refuses to fight, lamenting, 's*vajanam, svajanam*!'—my people, my people! The bonds of family were rooted in his very identity, and to Arjuna, to cut these bonds was to destroy himself! This was Arjuna's dilemma.\n\nIt is here that the Gītā begins, as Kṛṣṇa finally begins to speak.\n\nIn the succeeding chapters of the Gītā, Kṛṣṇa compassionately guides Arjuna, releasing him from his root thought pattern, guiding him to completion, and leading him to the ultimate knowledge—the knowledge of the Self, *ātmajñāna*. Arjuna is re-established in *jīvanmukti,* Living Enlightenment; the space of living Advaita*.*", "source": "bg_decoded", "book_id": "9d8fe9e90f5e07d315e1ed342c5cb6db"}
{"text": "### Understanding The Essence Of Kṛṣṇa's Teachings Through The Four Tattvas\n\nThe essence of Kṛṣṇa's teachings in the Gītā can be understood through four simple but powerful Universal principles, the four *tattvas—Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility and Enriching.* These four principles awaken the four innate great powers within us.\n\n**Integrity (sampūrti)** is you fulfilling the word and thought you give to yourself and to others, and experiencing a state of '*pūrnatva'*—completion with yourself and with life.\n\n**Authenticity (śraddha)** is you being established in the peak of your capability, and responding to life from who you perceive yourself to be for yourself, who you project yourself to be for others, and, what others expect you to be for them.\n\n**Responsibility (upāyanam)** is living and responding to life from the truth that you are the source of, and therefore, you are responsible for all happenings in and around you.\n\n**Enriching (āpyāyanam)** is you taking responsibility with integrity and authenticity, that you are committed to continuously enriching, which is expanding yourself and life, in and around you.\n\nAny problem or conflict you have in your life can be handled very practically, efficiently and skillfully with these four principles. THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM BHAGAWAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM can say with his entire experience that these four principles are the essence of all spiritual scriptures! They are the essence of life.\n\nThese four spiritual principles awaken four great inner powers in you. Each *tattva* is the key to unlock a corresponding power in you. Now, I will reveal these four inner powers that manifest when Kṛṣṇa's message is internalized and lived.\n\n#### Tattvas, Your Keys To Four Inner Powers\n\n*Listen! You actually have the power to simply manifest the reality of your choice!* \n\nWhether you know it or not, whether you believe it not, in each one of you is an enormous potential energy that expresses as four great powers.\n\nTo be able to unlock these great powers inside you, you must first understand a little more about yourself. They are related to the four major dimensions of your life—your words, your thinking, your emotions, and your living. When you awaken your peak possibility in each of these dimensions, it becomes a great power and support in your life.\n\nThese four inner powers are...\n\nThe power of words or *vāk śakti*. The power of words will be available to you when you practice Integrity.\n\nThe power of thoughts or *mano śakti.* The power of thinking will be open to you when you practice Authenticity.\n\nThe power of feeling or *prema śakti*. The power of feeling will be possible when you practice Responsibility.\n\nThe power of living or *ātma śakti*. The power of living will be established in you the moment you Enrich others.\n\nNow, I will summarize Kṛṣṇa's teachings through these *tattvas* and their powers.\n\n#### Integrity—The Strategy For Success\n\n#### *Listen!*\n\n#### *Your words are your life. Integrity is the key that unlocks the power of words.*\n\nWe all know honesty. Honesty is more like ethics, morality. But with the *tattva* of integrity, you are taking a step deeper than honesty. With honesty, you only have to honor the words that you give to others. With integrity, you also have to honor the words that you give to yourself. Honesty is not integrity. Integrity is honesty also.\n\nIt is very unfortunate that society teaches you to honor the words that you give to others, but forgets to teach you to honor the words that you give to yourself. The words you give to yourself are as important as—or more important than—the words you give to others. Because the flow of your life—the amount of contentment that you feel in your life, the degree of fulfillment that you feel in your life and the experience of fulfillment that you feel in your life—everything depends on the words that you have given to you!\n\nPlease understand, the words you give to yourself form the bone structure of your life. If you commit with yourself that you will become a doctor and you don't honor that word, and you don't even bother to complete that word inside your heart, then that word hangs inside you as a broken commitment given by you! Integrity is you not carrying the hangover of the commitments you have made, either to yourself or to others.\n\nWhen you break the commitments you give to you, you lose self-confidence. The more commitments you give and break, the more your self-confidence is lost. You lose confidence in you! When you break the commitments you give to others, it takes away their confidence in you. When you break the words you have given to yourself, you lose confidence in yourself. When you don't honor the words you give, and don't even bother to complete with them, the broken commitments that hang in your heart take away your self-confidence in life!\n\nThis is what happens to Arjuna on the battlefield.\n\nArjuna is a kṣatriya by birth, a warrior, a Pāṇḍava prince. When the Pāṇḍavas decide to wage war against their Kaurava cousins, Arjuna is perfectly aware that this includes a large part of his extended family! Yet he makes the decision to fight as per his *dharma*, as per his path as a *kṣatriya*. But when he enters the battlefield, he only sees 'friends', 'teachers', 'uncles' and 'relatives' leading the army, not the evil men who snatched away his kingdom and publicly insulted his brother and wife! Caught in the clutches of his parental conditioning, Arjuna instantly becomes powerless and decides to leave the battlefield.\n\nBy trying to escape from the battle, Arjuna falls completely out of integrity with his *dharma* as a warrior; he has slipped from his *dharma.* As a kṣatriya, he should have fulfilled the words he gave to himself, to his family, and to his Master; and he should have had the courage to face his decision of waging war against the Kauravas. Otherwise, he should not have taken the decision for war! But by becoming powerless and preparing to leave the battlefield, Arjuna is out of integrity with his *dharma*. This is what happens when you function out of your root pattern. You fall out of integrity with the words you give to yourself and others, and the root pattern takes over your response to life!\n\nUnderstand, taking responsibility for your words is practicing *dharma*, the right living. In Mahābhārat, *dharma* is defined as—'This is the essence of *dharma*. Do not do unto others that which would cause pain when done to you.'\n\nThe only way to come out of lack of integrity is through completion.\n\nThrough His dialogues with Arjuna on *sāṅkhya yoga* and *karma yoga*, the nature of life and the purpose of action, Kṛṣṇa helps Arjuna find the right understanding to complete with the limiting cognition created by his root thought pattern. Kṛṣṇa teaches Arjuna two key concepts— *Nityam* (the nature of the Eternal) and *na tvam śocitumarhasi* (the pointlessness of grieving). By revealing to Arjuna the truth about his true eternal self, Kṛṣṇa helps him with the right understanding to go beyond all the arguments of his logic and complete with his root pattern.\n\nArjuna then awakens his power of words that brings him the spontaneous intelligence and the clarity to use the right words to verbalize his real self-doubts. His initial powerless words of grief such as, '*katham bhiṣmamahaṁ saṅkhye dronaṁ ca madhūsudana* (2.4)—O Madhūsudana, how can I oppose Bhīṣma and Drona in the battle who are worthy of my worship?', now turn into words of enquiry such as, '*sthitaprajñasya kā bhāṣā samādhistaye keśava* (2.54)—what are the descriptions of the steady one who is merged in the awareness of truth and wisdom? How does he speak, how does he sit and how does he walk?'\n\nNow, Arjuna is ready for the next lesson—Authenticity, the power of thinking.\n\n#### Discover Your Peak Capacity Through Authenticity\n\n#### *With authenticity, you open the power of thinking in you!*\n\nWhen you unlock the power of thinking, you will be able to spontaneously focus your thoughts to achieve your highest potential.\n\nKṛṣṇa now initiates Arjuna into the path of authenticity in\n\naction and the path of knowledge in renunciation in *Karma Yoga* and *Jñāna-karma-sannyāsa Yoga. 'Yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam—*Yoga is authenticity in action,*'* declares Kṛṣṇa.\n\n> *karmaṇy evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadācana I mā karmaphala hetur bhur mā te saṅgo'stv akarmaṇi II 2.47*\n\n> *yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmāṇi saṅgaṁ tvaktvā dhanañjaya I siddhy-asiddhyoḥ samo bhūtvā samatvaṁ yoga ucyate II 2.48*\n\nThe entire teaching of *Bhagavad Gītā* can be summarized in these two verses. Nothing more can be said or ever needs to be said about why and how one should perform.\n\nKṛṣṇa says, 'You have the right only to work, but never to the results of that work. Let not the outcome be your motive; but do not move into inaction. Do what you have to do with a complete inner space centered on yoga. Be balanced in success and failure. Evenness of mind is yoga.'\n\nHe emphasizes again and again to be complete in yoga and drop all attachments—'Act without attachment. Do not worry about the success and failure in results of your actions. Surrender yourself to the wisdom of completion.'\n\nI am going to share an important concept here.\n\nListen! You don't have just a single identity, as you imagine. You have four identities!\n\nPlease understand, what you consider as *you* has four dimensions.\n\n1. *Mamakāra*—what you believe as you or *inner image.*\n\n2. *Ahaṁkāra* —what you project to others as you or *outer image.*\n\n3. *Anyakāra*—what others believe as you or *others' image.*\n\n4. *Svānyakāra* —what you believe life to be for you or *life image*.\n\nAll these identities put together is YOU.\n\nAuthenticity is nothing but keeping your four identities in tune and being at the peak of all four dimensions of you.\n\nUsually, what you think as you—your *mamakāra*, *inner image* is always less than what you are, and what you project as yourself to others—your *ahaṁkāra, outer image* is always more than what you are. For example, you may experience yourself as a very fearful person, but you will always project yourself as strong and powerful. Rarely, some people have a high *mamakāra*, but they project a low *ahaṁkāra* to others. And many times, the *others' image* or *anyakāra* that others have about you will be completely different from both your *mamakāra* and your *ahaṁkāra*!\n\nWhen one identity is fighting with another identity, how can your thinking be focused? All your energy is going to be used in reconciling your fighting identities. When all your identities or 'images' are in tune, all your thinking will be aligned in one direction. Your thinking becomes clear and sharp, like a laser beam. You will awaken the power of thinking.\n\nAuthenticity is not just you living at what *you think* as your peak, or what *you project* as your peak, but also at what *others think* as your peak and what *you experience* life to be for you. Only when you stretch yourself to others' image and expectations about you, you express extraordinary capacities and miracle powers.\n\nEvery time you raise yourself and stretch yourself to fulfill others' *anyakāra*, you achieve completion. You achieve fulfillment. You achieve union. Liberation from your individual identity happens to you only when you raise yourself to others' *anyakāra*. When you stretch yourself to others' *anyakāra*, liberation from *ahaṁkāra* and *mamakāra* happens!\n\nYou may think, 'I am responsible for what I feel as me, and what I project as me to others. But why should I take responsibility for others' expectations about me?'\n\nAs long as you think that you are stretching just because of others' expectation, you will carry continuous irritation, agitation and heaviness. Understand this important truth—It is YOU who is sitting in the inner consciousness of those who have expectations about you, and making\n\nthem expect things from you!\n\nListen: when you are not ready to listen to your own heart and expand, the Divine helps you by creating the same expectation in others, so that you can expand! It is some part of you which is suppressed by you, which wants to realize itself, that goes and sits in another's heart and becomes their expectation about you, so that the suppressed part is realized!\n        ```", "source": "bg_decoded", "book_id": "9d8fe9e90f5e07d315e1ed342c5cb6db"}
{"text": "### Chapter 1: The Root of *Mamakāra*\n\nAt the root of *mamakāra* is your *jīva*—your soul, in which all of us are one. If you suppress it in one body, it simply comes out in another body. When you are suppressing your expectations (*mamakāra*) about you in your own body, it simply comes out as *anyakāra* in another's body. Nobody else is forcing you. It is your own expectation about you, giving you one more chance! Now, it is no more somebody else's *anyakāra*. You are simply expanding to fulfill your own *mamakāra* and *ahaṁkāra*.\n\nOthers' expectation about you is nothing but a reminder, another chance that Bhagavān (Divine) gives you to realize yourself. When you realize that this is also your own expectation about you, you will have fulfillment!\n\nThe *Bhagavad Gītā* is the manifestation of Arjuna's suppressed longing to realize his own divine self. With authenticity, Arjuna discovers his power of thinking. He is now able to dive deeper into his suppressed thoughts and allows them to surface in Kṛṣṇa's Divine presence!\n\nIn the early chapters, Kṛṣṇa shares His *anyakāra* for Arjuna. He urges Arjuna to realize his eternal blissful *self*. He gives him an intellectual understanding of this truth. Through the chapters of *Jñana-karmasannyāsa Yogaḥ* and *Sannyāsa Yogaḥ,* Kṛṣṇa guides Arjuna on the ways to achieve this.\n\nKṛṣṇa gives the ultimate winning strategy of life to Arjuna—to stand up with the courage of authenticity in all his actions—*yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam*. He urges Arjuna to devote himself to yoga to expand himself to his peak energy.

{"text": "### Chapter 2: Responsibility—Waking Up To Your Highest Possibility\n\nKṛṣṇa's teachings in the next chapter, *Dhyāna Yoga*, can be summarized in these words—'Look in' and 'Take responsibility to raise yourself '.\n\n*Listen! Responsibility is the key that awakens the power of feeling.* The power of feeling is unlocked when you recognize yourself as a leader and take responsibility for everything in and around you!\n\nHere, Kṛṣṇa teaches Arjuna the techniques to go beyond the mind and senses and become liberated. He guides Arjuna to rise to the level of *Īśvaratva*, leadership consciousness and become like Himself.\n\nThat is why Kṛṣṇa says,\n\n*uddhared ātmanātmānaṁ nātmānaṁ avasāyadet I ātmaiva hy ātmano bandhur ātmaiva ripur ātmanaḥ II 6.5*\n\n'You are your own friend; you are your own enemy. Evolve yourself through the Self and do not degrade yourself.'\n\nBy this Kṛṣṇa means—if you know the technique of how to raise yourself by yourself, you are the friend of your Self. If you let yourself down, you are the enemy of your Self!\n\n> Listen: Responsibility means thinking, feeling, acting and cognizing life from the truth that YOU are the source of everything; therefore, you are responsible for all happenings inside you and around you.\n\nI know the big question you will all have now! You must be thinking, 'How can I be responsible for everything happening around me? I can be held responsible for what is happening inside me. How can I be held responsible for what is happening outside me? For example, if an accident happens in my life, how can I be responsible?'\n\nEverybody asks this question. Let me answer you.\n\n- A person who does not feel responsible even for his own actions is an animal. He lives at a very low level of consciousness!\n- A person who feels responsible for his own actions is a human being. He lives at the middle level of consciousness.\n- A person who takes responsibility even for others' actions is Divine. He lives in leadership consciousness, *Īśvaratva*.\n\nPlease understand, only when you feel that you are responsible for everything happening in and around you, you will start looking into the truth and start seeing the possibility for a solution. Only when you take responsibility will you even find the solution!\n\nListen. When you take responsibility, the higher energies express through you. Even if you take one step towards responsibility, the Cosmos takes a thousand steps towards you, taking responsibility for you. When you are in the space of responsibility, both your inner space and your outer space support you. The whole Universe supports you, because the Universe experiences its fulfillment through the cognition of those who feel responsible.\n\nTake responsibility in every situation. When you don't feel responsible, you are a drop in the ocean. When you feel responsible, you are the ocean in a drop! When you take responsibility, *Īśvaratva,* leadership consciousness starts happening in you.\n\n*The power of feeling is nothing but your ability to realize yourself as the source of all the happenings in your life.* This understanding gives you tremendous control over your own life and gives you the power to be a positive influence in the life of others.\n\nWith responsibility, life happens to you. But life always demands your expansion, because expansion is the natural flow of life. The more you engage with life, the greater the expansion that will be demanded of you. When you take responsibility for whatever is seen and experienced by you, that which is unseen and un-experienced by you takes responsibility for you! If you take responsibility for the known part of God and the world, the unknown part of God and the world takes responsibility for you. When God takes responsibility for you, you are God. You are an Incarnation!\n\nKṛṣṇa guides Arjuna to realize Kṛṣṇa consciousness through the *tattva* of responsibility. Kṛṣṇa's teaching of responsibility culminates in *Viśvarūpa Darśan,* where He blesses Arjuna with a glimpse of His Cosmic dimension, His infinite expansion—a foretaste of Arjuna's own Enlightenment.\n\nListen.\n\nYour expansion frightens you. Whenever bigness is demanded of you, whenever you feel you are being 'forced' to expand, you shrink even further into your comfort zone. Your tiredness, your weakness, your powerlessness all these are nothing but the resistance you have to seeing your own bigness!\n\nThat is what becomes of Arjuna after *Viśvarūpa Darśan*, the fear of expansion overtakes him. But being devoted to Kṛṣṇa, the embodiment of Cosmos, Arjuna responsibly expands and awakens his Enlightenment with the next *tattva* of enriching, the power of living. Kṛṣṇa assures him after the *darśan* that only by taking the responsibility to enrich others—by doing His work, by being undividedly devoted onto Him, can Arjuna expand himself into his highest possibility—*madkarma-kṛn mad-paramo mad-bhaktaḥ* (11.55)!", "source": "bg_decoded", "book_id": "9d8fe9e90f5e07d315e1ed342c5cb6db"}
